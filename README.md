Docker is a set of coupled software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service products that use operating-system-level virtualization to develop and deliver software in packages called containers.[clarification needed][6] The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.[7] It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.[8] The service has both free and premium tiers.  Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.[9] All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines. Containers are created from images that specify their precise contents. Images are often created by combining and modifying standard images downloaded from public repositories.[7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)
